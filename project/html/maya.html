      <h1>Early Age:</h1>
      <h2>
        Maya Angelou's early years were marked by significant challenges. At the
        age of three, her parents divorced, and she and her brother were sent to
        live with their grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas. Growing up in the
        racially segregated South, Angelou experienced firsthand the injustices
        of racism and discrimination. Despite these hardships, she found solace
        in literature and poetry, developing a love for storytelling and
        language that would shape her future career as a writer.
      </h2>

      <h1>Hardships:</h1>
      <h2>
        Throughout her life, Maya Angelou faced numerous hardships, including
        poverty, trauma, and racism. At the age of eight, she was sexually
        abused by her mother's boyfriend, an experience that left her deeply
        scarred. The trauma of her childhood experiences led Angelou to become
        selectively mute for several years, finding refuge in books and writing
        as a means of expression.
      </h2>

      <p></p>
      <h1>What She Fought For:</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h2>
        Maya Angelou used her voice and platform to advocate for social justice,
        equality, and human rights. Through her writing and activism, she
        challenged societal norms and spoke out against racism, sexism, and
        oppression. Angelou believed in the power of storytelling to foster
        empathy and understanding, and she used her own experiences as a source
        of inspiration and empowerment for others. Throughout her life, she
        remained committed to uplifting marginalized communities and amplifying
        the voices of the voiceless, leaving behind a legacy of courage,
        resilience, and compassion.
